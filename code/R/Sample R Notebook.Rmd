R Notebooks use R Markdown.  Code stored in "chunks."  Chunks can be executed individually or as a group.  Code can be in a variety of lanugages -- noteably for us -- R, Python, and SQL.  Information at: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/.

Example of an R chunk:

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
What is 'cars?' -- try Help!
```{r}
?cars
```

Hmmmm ... datasets?
```{r}
?datasets
```

```{r}
library(help = "datasets")
```
